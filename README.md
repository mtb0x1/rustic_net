# Rustic Net

**🚧 Experimental Machine Learning Framework 🚧**

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This project is intentionally experimental and vibe coded (with variety of tools and models). It's not intended for production use. The goal is to explore, play, and push boundaries within machine learning and artificial intelligence frameworks.

## 🎯 Purpose
Rustic Net is a playground for exploring unconventional approaches to deep learning and neural networks. Expect:
- Unconventional behavior
- Experimental features
- Breaking changes
- Raw, unfiltered exploration

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Rust (latest stable version recommended)
- Cargo (Rust's package manager)

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rustic_net.git
cd rustic_net
cargo build
```

## 🧪 Features
- Experimental neural network implementations
- Research-focused architecture
- Cutting-edge (and sometimes unstable) features
- Playground for AI/ML research
